Whiteboarding:

- Whisper
	- Where we transcribe
- GPT-4
	- 
- React

# Core Desired Goals

- HTML on a web UI that you can record notes about that are summarized
- Generate list of `facts` based on the assertions they've made over the course of their review
- 
# Potential Enhancements

- Storage
- Database?
- Using actual/custom data/documents
- Streaming audio instead of batch-based

# Emergent ideas

- What if we had like a very simple Web UI that's a doc viewer that doesn't do any of the old stuff, but just does the new fancy stuff we want?
- Can we just build out a new dev environment for this.
- Inline citations that take you to the source document

# Path forward

- Murad -- Build off of existing R11 UI onto different pages and whatnot
- Karan -- Bulk of whisper config/fine tuning
- Nick -- Server setup/automation
	- Containerization and deployment to k8s
	- Create separate deployment of R11 in dev for Hackathon
	- Potentially Nick works on better streaming if he has time.
